1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate,  reproductive rate)

Population size: 100000
Percent Vaccinated: 95%
Virus name: Smallpox
Mortality rate: 0.15
Repro rate: 0.6

> Smallpox 0.6 0.15 100000 0.95


2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

The largest concurrent percentage of infected people was 1.321% (1,321/100,000)
The total number of infected people was 4.685% (4,685/100,000)

3.  What percentage of the population died from the virus?

0.664% (664/100,000) died from the virus

4.  Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?

There were 453,830 interactions between an infected individual and a vaccinated one
